        <img src="images/avengers.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
                Avengers: Endgame is not just a movie its itâ€™s an emotion and expression from the last 
                10 years in MCU. From the start of Phase 1 in Mcu in 2008 with Iron-Man to 2019 Captain 
                Marvel its all about how the character is develop. And how they work together to over come their 
                biggest Failure from Infinity war. Its the highest grossing film of the era crossing over James 
                Cameron Avatar. </p>

               <p> The movie start with the heros looking for Thanos after the Snap in Infinity war, so that they can 
                take revenge over him. They found him and found out that he had already destroyed the infinity stones
                so they are hopeless on getting their friend back and kill Thanos by chopping his head off. Then the movie
                goes 5 years after, all the superheroes are looking the way to get all of them back. And Ant-Man who 
                is in Quantum Realm come back and talk about the time travel as the time work differently in Time Vortex.
                With the concept of that Tony become able to create Time Heist so that they goes to the past and collect all
                the Infinity Stones. Movies then start with emotionally connected and giving the felling of all the Movies
                from past as the collection of stone and it is really awesome. And after the collection of all the stones they
                are able to snap and bring their friends back. And the last Battle happen between the Heros and Thanos army 
                as the young Thanos does the time travel and this time with sacrifies of Iron_Man during snap they become able
                to win over him. With the end of movie Tony(Iron-Man) and Natasha(Black Widow) got dead and with their
                sacrifies they are able to win over Thanos.
