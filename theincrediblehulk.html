            The Incredible Hulk is a 2008 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character the 
            Hulk, produced by Marvel Studiosand distributed by Universal Pictures. It is the second film in 
            the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Louis Leterrier, with a screenplay 
            by Zak Penn. It stars Edward Norton as Bruce Banner, alongside Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, Tim Blake 
            Nelson, Ty Burrell, and William Hurt. In The Incredible Hulk, Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk as an 
            unwitting pawn in a military scheme to reinvigorate the supersoldier program through gamma 
            radiation. On the run, he attempts to cure himself of the Hulk before he is captured by General 
            Thaddeus Ross, but his worst fears are realized when power-hungry soldier Emil Blonsky becomes a 
            similar, but more bestial creature.

​

 

                After the mixed reception to the 2003 film Hulk, Marvel Studios reacquired the rights to 
                the character. Leterrier, who had expressed interest in directing Iron Man, was brought 
                onboard and Penn began work on a loose sequel that would


            be much closer to the comics and the 1978 television series of the same name. In April 2007, Norton was 
            hired to portray Banner and to rewrite Penn's screenplay in order to distance itself from the 2003 film 
            and establish its own identity as a reboot, although he would go uncredited for his writing. Filming 
            mostly took place in Toronto, Ontario, from July to November 2007. Over 700 visual effects shots were 
            created in post-production using a combination of motion capture and computer-generated imagery to 
            complete the film.
