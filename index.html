                Avengers: Endgame ripped my heart out - it was so emotional. I watched this 3 times, 
                and still choke when it gets to the end. The cast is outstanding, and it is hard to 
                single anyone out. For me, Gwyneth Paltrow and Tom Holland gave the most poignant and 
                touching performances. A perfect end to this chapter and an Oscar-worthy performance, 
                And I still say this - Kevin Feige is a genius. Robert Downey Jr deserves a Best Actor 
                Oscar, the cast deserve Best Ensemble, the Russo Brothers Best Directors. And, 
                Avengers: Endgame deserves a Best Film nomination as well. Simply brilliant!

                Both more intimate and bigger than Infinity War, the film meets expectations as much as 
                it is busting them. You probably shouldn't think too hard about some parts and there are 
                certainly some polarizing decisions in the first half. But then the film celebrates its 
                predecessors and its fans, rewarding those who paid close attention for over ten years. 
                A touching, funny, surprising and most importantly worthy goodbye to this phase of modern 
                popcorn cinema. What a ride it's been. Edit: Gets half a star more after the second round, 
                where the plot holes, open questions and inconsistencies didn't bother me as much once the 
                full fledged fan fest was in full swing. Never has a film been more unwatchable and 
                incoherent for the unknowing, yet a dream come true for the rest.
