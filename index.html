                Avengers: Endgame has totally taken my heart out - it was so emotional. I watched this 3 times, 
                and still i keep shivering when it gets to the end. The cast is outstanding, and it is hard to 
                single anyone out. Robert Downey Jr deserves a Best Actor 
                Oscar his acting and performance is phenomenal.

                Endgame is not just a film it’s an emotion and expression from the last 10 years in MCU 
                (Avengers: Endgame is not just a film. It is not just the “season finale” of the Marvel 
                Cinematic Universe). You probably shouldn't think too hard about some parts and there are 
                certainly some decisions in the first half. But then the film celebrates its 
                predecessors and its fans, rewarding those who paid close attention for over ten years. 
                And movie is divided into three different phase as Time Heist, Hangover from 
                Infinity War and final phase which makes the movie more interesting and emotional connect 
                about how the Avengers takes revenge with Thanos on his Snap. Movie mainly takes about the 
                failure of heroes about not being able to sacrifices anyone to win the war whereas Thanos is 
                doing everything to fulfill his dreams (Time and again in that film, Thanos was able to win 
                because The Avengers were not willing to sacrifice one another to stop him) Avengers: Endgame 
                is unexpected movie and able to catch the attraction from every field and become the highest 
                grossing movie of all time.
