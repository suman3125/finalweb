        <h2>WHAT ARE THE INFINITY STONES?</h2>
<p>Within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Infinity Stones are six artifacts that endow their bearers with a variety of powerful 
abilities. When brought together into a glove known as the Infinity Gauntlet, the Stones give their user 
the power to reshape all of reality itself.

The Stones have played minor roles as MacGuffins in many Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, and those 
assorted plot threads are all building up to Avengers: Infinity War, a film in which the ownership and 
    </p>

<h2>WHERE ARE THE INFINITY STONES IN THE MOVIES?</h2>
    <p>Ah, now we have come to the crux of the matter. In Guardians of the Galaxy, it was explained that the six 
“stones” are actually six singularities whose existence preceded the Big Bang and were pressed into stones 
fter the universe began.

Unlike their comic book counterparts, the Infinity Stones are only sometimesphysical gems, occasionally 
taking the form of strange gases or powerful cubes. Some of them have featured largely in the MCU while 
disguised, with their true nature revealed after the fact.

Here’s the location and form of each Infinity Stone, in order of their first appearance in the Marvel 
Cinematic Universe. It’s accurate to the timestamp on this post.</p>

<h2>THE SPACE STONE</h2>
    <p>The first Infinity Stone to appear in a Marvel movie, this one’s form — as a glowing blue cube about 
the size of a softball known as the Tesseract — was a neat red herring for another powerful Marvel Comics 
artifact, the Cosmic Cube.

[Warning: This description contains spoilers for Thor: Ragnarok. If you haven’t seen it yet, skip to below 
hat picture of the Vision.]

The Hydra agent known as the Red Skull sought it in Captain America: The First Avenger. Then it was 
recovered by S.H.I.E.L.D. in the 21st century, stolen by Loki and subsequently used to open the portal 
that brought the Chitauri army to New York in The Avengers. At the end of The Avengers, Thor returned it 
to Asgard’s armory for safekeeping.

The Tesseract was seen multiple times in Odin’s treasure room in Thor: Ragnarok, in which all of Asgard 
was destroyed utterly by the fire demon, Surtur. The final time it appeared was when Loki visited the 
vault to recover Surtur’s skull.

Ragnarok gave us a good look at the god of mischief giving it a significant glance, so he could easily 
have stolen it. And in trailers for Avengers: Infinity War, it appears that he did just that — one shot 
shows Loki holding the Tesseract in his outstretched hand, seemingly offering it to someone.</p>

<h2>THE MIND STONE</h2>
    <p>The Mind Stone first appeared, secretly, in The Avengers. Originally hidden in the tip of Loki’s 
mind-control scepter, it’s one of the most well-traveled and consequential Stones of the lot.

The Scepter was a gift from Thanos, who’d also financed the Chitauri army and rescued Loki from the 
void after he fell from Asgard’s rainbow bridge in Thor, in exchange for Loki leading the army to Earth. 
During The Avengers, that scepter was confiscated for study by S.H.I.E.L.D., and in 
Captain America: The Winter Soldier, it was re-confiscated by Hydra in the latter’s takeover. 
It was used to awaken the powers of the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, before being re-re-confiscated by 
the Avengers in The Avengers: Age of Ultron.

Tony Stark and Bruce Banner used the scepter to create the evil artificial intelligence Ultron, 
who was the first to realize that the scepter’s power actually resided in the Mind Stone, which was 
inside the scepter. Ultron attempted to use the Mind Stone to craft a new body for himself.

That body was recovered by the Avengers before he could insert his consciousness into it, and brought to 
life as the android the Vision, endowed with sentience by the Mind Stone embedded in his forehead.

As of right now, the Mind Stone is still in the Vision’s forehead. It’s yellow.</p>

<h2>THE REALITY STONE</h2>
    <p>The Reality Stone featured prominently only in Thor: The Dark World, where its malleable form, known as 
the Aether, was used as a weapon by the Dark Elf villain Malekith. At the end of the film, the Reality 
Stone was captured by Asgardian forces and brought to the Collector, and ancient being who ... collects 
stuff, for safekeeping. Apparently keeping two Stones in close proximity in Asgard’s armory was considered 
o be too dangerous, and they already had the Space Stone, or Tesseract.

As far as we know, the Collector still holds the Reality Stone, though his base of operations was pretty 
badly trashed in Guardians of the Galaxy. It is red.</p>

<h2>THE POWER STONE</h2>
    <p>Speaking of Guardians of the Galaxy, its plot was centered around the Power Stone, recovered from an 
ancient ruin by Peter Quill and sought by the Collector and Ronan the Accuser. Ronan was supposed to be 
grabbing it for Thanos, but decided instead to use its abilities to try to take revenge on the people of 
the planet Xandar.

After Ronan was defeated by the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Power Stone was given to Xandar’s Nova Corps, 
nd is presumably in their possession still. It is purple.</p>

<h2>THE TIME STONE</h2>
    <p>The Time Stone features prominently in Doctor Strange, in which the eponymous hero uses the Eye of 
Agamotto’s power to control time when he defeated the demon Dormammu. Earth’s first sorcerer, Agamotto, 
had bound the Time Stone into a pendant thousands of years before.

At the end of Doctor Strange, Doctor Strange returns the Eye to the stronghold of Kamar-Taj in Nepal, 
where it likely still remains. Its color is green.</p>

<h2>THE SOUL STONE</h2>
    <p>The history, form and location of the Soul Stone is unknown, but it has been established, by process of 
elimination and by Guardians of the Galaxy, to be ... orange.

Marvel Studios executive Kevin Feige has said that it will appear “sometime in Phase Three, for sure,” 
which, since the Soul Stone didn’t show up in Black Panther, could only mean Avengers: Infinity War itself.

After Infinity War, the Marvel Cinematic Universe will enter its Phase Four, and at that point just about 
anything could happen.
